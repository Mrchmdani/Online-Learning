HTML & CSS I

Getting Started with HTML & CSS
    Welcome to the exciting world of HTML & CSS!
    In this lesson, we're going to create the website displayed in the image below.
    It may look difficult, but don't worry! We'll guide you every step of the way.
-->

<!--
What are HTML & CSS?
    Most websites are created with languages called HTML and CSS.
    By learning these two powerful languages, you will be able to build websites like the ones below.

How HTML Works
    Let's get started with HTML!
    The first rule of writing HTML code is to surround text with tags.
    Tags give a meaning, such as a heading or a link, to text.

Opening and Closing Tags
    Most HTML elements require a pair of tags, an opening tag and a closing tag, with text inserted in between.
    When using closing tags, make sure to put "/".

Heading Tags

    Heading tags are used to format heading elements.
    These tags range from <h1> to <h6>, <h1> being the largest and <h6> being the smallest (※ h stands for heading).
-->
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h6>Hello World</h6>

<!--
Paragraph Tag
    The <p> tag defines a paragraph (※ p stands for paragraph). The text enclosed by tags such as <h2> and <p> begin on a new line. 

Using Headings and Paragraphs
    The <h1>...<h6> tags are used according to the size and importance of headings as shown below.
    For text that is not a heading, let's use the <p> tag.
-->
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>Let's learn to code</h2>

<!--
Comments
    This is comment code.
    Comments are not displayed in the browser, so they are useful for explaining your code.
-->
<!-- Comment -->

<!--
Link Tag (1)
    You can easily create a link with the <a> tag (※ a stands for anchor).
    The text in <a> tags is displayed in the browser as a link text.

Link Tag (2)
    Every link has a destination.
    So, in order to make any link work, you'll need to specify a destination URL in the <a> element by adding the href attribute.
    As shown in the image on the left, the destination URL goes in the url part of <a href="url">.

HTML Attributes
    In HTML, you can specify an attribute like href in the opening tag (※ see the image on the left).
    Always put attribute values in double quotes ".
-->
<a>Progate</a>
<a href="https://progate.com">Progate</a>
<a href="https://google.com">To Google</a>

<!--
Image Tag
    The <img> tag is used to display an image.
    We can set the image by specifying the url in the src attribute as follows: <img src="url">.
    Note that <img> tags don't require closing tags as they don't enclose any text.
-->

<img src="https://progate.com/images/html/beginner/school.jpg">

<!--
Lists
    You can create a list item by enclosing the text with <li> tags.
    We'll cover the <ul> tag on the next slide.

Lists (2)
    The type of list items changes depending on the tag you use.
    With the <ul> tag, you can create bulleted lists.
    When elements are "nested" like this, the enclosing element becomes the parent and the enclosed elements become its children.

Indentation
    For nested elements, it's a good practice to align code with indentation.
    Although not required, indentation makes it easier to see the parent-child relationship especially when your code becomes complicated
    (※ to indent, press the "tab" key at the beginning of a line).

</ul>

<!--
What is CSS?
    CSS is used to design a website. With CSS, you can change things like the color, size, and spacing of HTML elements.
    The page on the left is comprised of only HTML.
    By applying CSS, you can style it like the layout shown on the right.

How CSS Works
    CSS is written in a separate file from HTML.
    You can apply CSS to HTML elements by specifying "where," "what," and "how" you want to change it.
    In the example below, CSS is applied to an <h1> element (the "where") and its color (the "what") is changed to red (the "how").
    The target HTML element is called the selector.

Colors
    Let's learn about the color property!
    In CSS, colors are specified by hexadecimal values like color: #ff0000;.
    You don't need to remember the values, but you can search online for other colors if you're interested.

CSS Syntax
    There are a few things to keep in mind when writing CSS.
    Just like HTML, you should always indent CSS code as shown below.
    Also, note that it is necessary to add a colon : at the end of a CSS property and a semicolon ; at the end of the line.

CSS Comments
    Just as you did in HTML, you can write comments in a CSS file.
    In CSS, however, a comment should be surrounded by /* */.
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE ON HTML & CSS I.css ##

<!--
Font Size
    The size of a font can be set with the font-size property.
    A common unit for setting the font-size is px (pixel).

Font Family
    With the font-family property, you can specify the type of font.
    You can do this by setting font-family: font name;.
    If the font name contains a space, you need to surround it with double quotes.

    Variety of Fonts
    When setting the font-family property, you can specify various font types such as "serif" and "sans-serif".
    You don't have to memorize the name of the fonts.
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE ON HTML & CSS I.css ##

<!--
Background Colors
    The background-color property allows you to change the background color. You can set the background color just like the color property.
    In addition, if the same letter continues like #dddddd, it can be shortened to #ddd.

Width and Height
    To change the width and height of an element, use the width property and height property, respectively. 
    Both of these can be specified with px. As with the font-size, don't forget to put the px!
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE ON HTML & CSS I.css ##

<!--
Applying CSS to a certain element
    When there are multiple <li> elements in your code, applying CSS like the image below would turn all the <li> elements red.
    So, how do we change only one of the <li> elements to red?

Labeling Tags
    You can achieve this by labeling elements using the class attribute.
    By adding a class to an HTML tag, you can differentiate each element and apply different CSS.
    When applying CSS to a class selector, note that a period . is required in front of the class name.

Applying CSS to Multiple Tags
    If you assign the same class name to multiple HTML elements, the same CSS applies to all of them.

Syntax for Classes
    As noted before, class selector names always start with a period.
    If you forget the period, the CSS will not be applied.
    Note that CSS class selectors start with a period, but tags do not.
-->
<ul>
    <li class="selected">HTML</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>Ruby</li>
</ul>

<!--
Your First Website
    Now it's time to create your first website!
    Check out the image below to get an idea of what you'll create.

The Structure of HTML
    In an actual HTML document, there are some rules you need to follow.
    For example, the <head> and the <body> elements are required in the <html> element (※ See the image on the left).
    The <head> element contains information of the document while the <body> element contains the contents that are visible in the browser.

Specifying the HTML Version
    In every HTML document, you need to start with the DOCTYPE declaration, which indicates the specific HTML version for your website.
    We'll be using <!DOCTYPE html>, which is for HTML, the latest version of HTML. 
    Don't worry too much about the specific type, just remember that it's something you always have to specify.

<head> Tag
    The <head> element contains the settings of the HTML document that are not visible in the browser.
    There are three elements you need to put in the <head> element.
    We will take a look at each one of them in the next lesson.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <h1>Progate</h1>
    <p>Learn to Code</p>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

<!--
Contents within the <head> Tag
    Within the <head> element, we will specify 1) the character encoding, 2) the title of the website, and 3) the link to a CSS file.
    You don't have to know them by heart, but let's see what these elements mean.

Character Encoding
    By specifying the character encoding in the charset attribute as <meta charset="utf-8">, you can prevent the website from garbling.
    UTF-8 is the recommended character encoding for HTML.

Title for Your Website
    The <title> element specifies the title of the document.
    As shown in the image on the right, the title specified in the <title> element appears on the browser tab.

Linking a CSS file
    In our exercises, the CSS code you write in stylesheet.css is immediately reflected in the preview window. However, this is normally not the case. 
    You need to create a link between an HTML and CSS file by defining <link rel="stylesheet"> in the HTML.
    You can specify the name of the CSS file using the href attribute.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">                          <!--1) specify the character encoding -->
    <title>Document</title>                         <!--2) specify the title -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">   <!--3) specify which css file to load -->
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

<!--
The Layout
    Layout is one of the most important parts of building a website.
    The layout of the website we're going to build is made up of mainly three parts as shown in the image below.
    Let's get started!

<div> Tag
    We're going to create the layout with <div> elements (※ "div" stands for "division").
    The <div> tag is used to group elements.
    In the example below, the layout is divided by three <div> elements with class names header, main, and footer.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Progate</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Add a <div> tag with the "header" class -->
    <div class="header">Header</div>
    
    <!-- Add a <div> tag with the "main" class -->
    <div class="main">main</div>
    
    <!-- Add a <div> tag with the "footer" class -->
    <div class="footer">footer</div>
    
  </body>
</html>

<!--
The Header
    Now that the basic layout is complete, let's work on some details.
    We're first going to make a header like the one below.

The Structure of the Header
    Let's check out the structure of the header.
    There is a "Progate" logo and a list.
    Let's group these two parts using the <div> element as shown below.
    
Removing the Bullets from List Items
    By applying the list-style property on an <li> element, you can remove the bullet points.
    Since we don't want bullets for our list, let's set the list-style to none.
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE ON HTML & CSS I.css ##

<!--
Aligning the Header Horizontally
    Generally, elements written in HTML are vertically aligned.
    To horizontally align them, we need CSS.
    Next, we'll learn how to create the layout shown below on the right.

The Float Property
    Using the float property, you can align targeted elements horizontally. As shown in the examples, specifying float: left; will arrange elements side by side from left to right.

Aligning List Item Side by Side
    Let's start arranging the list items in the header side by side.
    By applying float: left; to every <li> element, you can align them horizontally from left to right.

Aligning the Logo and the List
    Next, let's place the header logo and the entire list side by side.
    By applying float: left; to the header-logo as shown below, you can horizontally align the logo and the entire list.
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE ON HTML & CSS I.css ##

<!--
Adjusting Spaces
    Let's adjust the spaces between the elements in the header so that both the logo and header list are placed in the appropriate positions as shown below.

Adding Space to an Element
    When you want to add some space to an element, the padding property comes in handy. By applying padding: 〇〇px;, the specified space is added to all sides of an element.

Applying Padding to Only One Side
    You may want to add padding to only one side of an element instead of all sides. In that case, you can apply padding independently by using properties like padding-top and padding-bottom.
    For example, to add the top padding, set padding-top: 〇〇px;.

Padding Shorthand
    You can use shorthand when applying padding.
    You can apply padding to multiple sides using only one property.
    When four values are defined, padding is applied clockwise from the top. When two values are defined, padding is applied in the order of "top / bottom" and "right / left".
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE ON HTML & CSS I.css ##

<!--
The Footer
    Next, we're going to work on the layout of the footer.
    As with the header, let's check out the design and the structure.
    On the left side of the footer is the logo, and on the right is the list.

The Structure of the Footer
    When we created the header, we applied float and padding to every <li> element. Because of that, the CSS properties are also applied to the <li> elements in the footer.
    How do you think we can apply these CSS properties only to the <li> tags in the header?

Nested Selectors
    By adding li after header-list with a space in between, you can apply CSS to only the <li> elements in the header-list.
    This allows you to apply different CSS to the <li> elements in the header from those in the footer.
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE ON HTML & CSS I.css ##

<!--
Rearranging the Logoand the List
    Let's look at the images below.
    The footer logo and list are respectively located at the far left and right.
    We learned how to align elements from the left using float: left, but how do we place them on the right edge?

float: right
    With float: right, you can horizontally align the targeted elements from right to left.

Positioning Elements Left and Right
    By combining float: left; and float: right;, you can place the logo and the list in a row from left to right.
    Let's apply float: left; to the footer-logo selector so that it is placed on the left edge. Also apply float: right; to the footer-list selector to move it to the right edge.
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE ON HTML & CSS I.css ##

<!--
The Main Layout
    Let's move on to the main layout!
    As shown below, it consists of three elements, copy-container, contents, and contact-form.
    It may look a bit more complicated than other layouts we've created. But don't worry! We'll explain each step for you to follow along.

Applying CSS to a Part of Text
    In the image below, notice that the period (.) in the <h1> element "HELLO WORLD." is colored red. We'll show you how to apply CSS to only a part of a text.

<span> Tag
    You can apply CSS to a part of a text by putting it in a <span> tag. The images below illustrate this by applying color: red; to a span selector. 
    There is no new line inserted before or after a <span> element.

Block-Level and Inline Elements
    In HTML, some elements start on a new line while others don't.
    Block-level elements like divs contain a new line before and after the element, and extend to the full width of their parent element.
    Inline elements like spans only take up as much width as necessary.
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE CSS ON HTML & CSS I.css ##
<div class="main">
    <!-- Add a <div> tag with the "copy-container" class -->
    <div class="copy-container">
      <h1>HELLO WORLD<span>.</span></h1>
      <h2>Let's learn to code</h2>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Add a <div> tag with the "contents" class -->
    <div class="contents"></div>
    
    <!-- Add a <div> tag with the "contact-form" class -->
    <div class="contact-form"></div>
    
  </div>

<!--
    The Content
    The next part is the content.
    First, let's make the layout of the content section.
    We need the title and 4 contents-items.
-->
<div class="contents">
    <h3>Lessons</h3>
    <div class="contents-item">
        <img src="https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/progate/shared/images/lesson/html/study/html.svg">
        <p>HTML & CSS</p>
    </div>
    <div class="contents-item">
        <img src="https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/progate/shared/images/lesson/html/study/php.svg">
        <p>PHP</p>
    </div>
    <div class="contents-item">

        <p>Swift</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--
Borders
    In the image below, the <h3> element has a border under it.
    Let's learn how to add a border to an element on the next slide.

Syntax for Borders
    You can add a border with the border property.
    As shown in the images, you can specify the thickness, style, and color.
    Using the border property will apply a border to all sides. 
    If you want to add it only to a specific side, use one of the following properties: border-bottom, border-top, border-left, or border-right.
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE ON HTML & CSS I.css ##

<!--
Space Inside andOutside of Borders
    As shown below, there are spaces added above and below the border.
    On the next slide, we're going to learn how to add space inside and outside of a border.

Padding and Margin
    Earlier, we used the padding property to create space around an element. However, the padding adds space inside its border.
    The margin property, though, adds space outside the border.
    You can specify the values just like you did for the padding.

The Box Model
    The border, padding, and margin properties we've covered so far are based on the concept of the box model.
    Every HTML element has a border (most are not visible by default).
    The space outside the border is margin, and the inside is padding.

Margin Shorthand
    Just like the padding property, you can specify multiple margins in each direction individually, or all at once using only one property.
-->
## SEE EXAMPLE ON HTML & CSS I.css ##

<!--
    Forms
    Finally, let's make an inquiry form just like the one below!
-->
<div class="contact-form">
    <!-- Add a <h3> tag with the "section-title" class -->
      <h3 class="section-title">Contact Us</h3>
    
    <!-- Add three <p> tags below -->
    <p>Email (Required)</p>
    <p>Message (Required)</p>
    <p> * Required fields must be filled.</p>
    
</div>

<!--
<input> and <textarea> Tags
    Let's see how to make input fields.
    The <input> tag is used for receiving a single line of text while the <textarea> tag is suitable for a multiline text.
    Note that the <input> tag doesn't require a closing tag.

Submit Button
    We can also create a submit button by adding the type attribute to an <input> element. When you set the type attribute to submit, the <input> element becomes a submit button like the image below.
    By default, the text displayed on the button is "Submit" in English browsers.

Value Attribute
    If you wish, you can change the text displayed on a submit button by specifying the value attribute.
-->
<form>
    <p>input element</p>
    <input>                         <!-- display an input field for a single line -->
    <p>textarea element</p>
    <textarea></textarea>           <!-- display an input field for multiple lines -->
</form>

<input type="submit">               <!-- submit button -->

<input type="submit" value="send">  <!-- changes the text displayed on the button -->

<!--
Applying CSS to Multiple Selectors
    You can group the same CSS by separating multiple selectors with a comma , as shown in the center image. By doing so, you can apply the same CSS to different selectors.
    For our website, let's apply the same CSS to <input> and <textarea> elements using this method.
