Responsive Web Design
    In this lesson, we'll be applying Responsive Web Designto the web page we developed in the previous lesson.
    Responsive Web Design adapts to all types of screen sizes and devices to display the contents of the website.
    Itâ€™s especially important for website creation considering the necessity to display on smartphones.
-->

<!--
Applying Responsive Web Design
    By applying responsive web design to the website created during the previous lesson, you can change the layout display to fit screen size, as seen in the image below.
-->

<!--
Media Queries
    From here on, we'll be learning about media queries.
    They allow you to specify different CSS depending on the size of the device.

Using Media Queries
    Let's learn how to write media queries.
    The syntax is as follows: @media (condition) { .... }.
    The CSS inside { } will be applied only when the condition is met.3

max-width and min-width
    We can specify the max-width or the min-width as a condition.
    When max-width: 1000px is specified, the CSS will be applied only when the width of the screen is 1000px or less.
    On the other hand, with min-width the CSS will be applied when the width of the screen is the specified size or more.

Breakpoints
    The value you specify for the max-width or the min-width is called a breakpoint.
    We'll be using 670px as the breakpoint for smartphones, and 1000px for tablets.

Layout with Media Queries
    In the previous lesson, we learned how to change the color of the text based on the width of the device.
    Now let's learn how to change the layout.

Changing the Width Using Media Queries
    When you have several items in a row, they will look too small when displayed on smaller devices.
    Let's fix this by changing the width of each item for smaller devices.

<!--
box-sizing
    The image on the left shows what would happen if we added padding to the items in the previous exercise. 
    Having four items with 25% width along with the padding will cause the width to be greater than 100%, and so the last item will not fit.
    We can fix this using box-sizing: border-box;.

How box-sizing Works
    By setting the box-sizing property to border-box, an element's width will include the padding and the border.
    Therefore, the layout will not break when you add padding or border (this is not the case with margin).

Applying CSS to All Elements
    You can use the * selector when you want to apply CSS to all the elements, like in the image below.
    It's a good practice to apply box-sizing: border-box; to all the elements because it will make it easier to adjust the layout of the web page.

Making Your Page Responsive
We've learned the basics of Responsive Web Design. Let's put it into practice by applying it to the web page that we made in the previous lesson. 
To begin, we have a few things that we need to prepare.

viewport
In preparation for applying Responsive Web Design to the page, let's set the viewport inside the <head> tag. 
Without the viewport, the media queries won't function properly on tablets and smartphones. You don't have to memorize the content of the viewport.

width: 100%
In the previous lesson, we had the width fixed to 1170px, so it won't fit into devices with smaller screens. 
Let's change the width to 100% so that it fills whatever the width for any device.
-->

<meta name="viewport" content="width= device-width, initial-scale=1.0">             <!-- set the viewport -->

<!-- Example -->

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!-- Set the viewport using a <meta> tag -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    
    <title>Progate</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
</head>

<!--
Loading responsive.css
    We could write our media queries in stylesheet.css, but we'll put them in a different file, responsive.css, to keep our CSS organized.
    Make sure that you load responsive.css below the viewport.

The Width of lesson
    Let's start with the layout for tablets.
    With tablets, there isn't enough width to fit four lessons in one row.
    Let's fix this by placing only two lessons in one row.
    We can do this by changing the width of lesson to 50%.
-->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="responsive.css">              <!-- load responsive css -->

<!--
Fixing the Background
    Since we've changed the lessons to be shown in two rows, they no longer fit inside the section with the background color.
    This is because the height of lesson-wrapper is fixed to 580px.
    Let's remove this so that the height of lesson-wrapper will be determined by its children.

float and the Parent Element
    By default, an element's height is determined by that of its children.
    But this is not the case when all the child elements have float applied, in which case the height of the parent will be 0.
    This is because the floating elements will not affect the parent.

Clearing the float
    Let's learn how to add height to an element with floating children.
    We can do this by adding an empty <div> tag with clear: left; applied.
    clear: left; cancels the children's float state, so their height will affect the parent element's height.

The Smartphone Layout
    Now let's work on the layout for smartphones.
    We'll set the breakpoint to 670px.
    Let's first change the width of lesson to 100% to make a single column layout.

Aligning the footer
    Also, let's set the footer to align in the center when viewed from smartphone devices.

<!--
Adjusting the Buttons
    Next, let's make the buttons spread to the full-width so that they are easier to tap.
    We'll also adjust the margin between the buttons.

Making the font-size Responsive
    Smaller fonts will fit better in a smaller screen.
    So, let's adjust the font for each device.

<!--
Handling Large Screens
    We've learned how to adjust the layout for smaller devices.
    What about devices with larger screens?
    For example, if we viewed our web page on a 2000px screen, the lessons will be too far apart from each other.

max-width
    Since we've set the width of container to 100%, it will become too
    big on a larger screen. We can fix this by setting the max-width.
    In the example, we've set the max-width to 1170px, so the content inside will always be contained within this limit.

<!--
Making the Header Responsive
    To finish off, let's apply a different header for smartphones.
    Since the whole menu won't fit, we'll display a menu icon instead.
    (This way, you can display the menu when the icon is tapped.)

Hiding and Showing Elements
    We'll hide the menu icon by default and only display it when the device width is 670px or less.
    To hide an element, we can use display: none;.
    To display a hidden element, we can use display: block;.
-->

<a href="#" class="menu icon">
    <span class="fa fa-bars"></span>
</a>
