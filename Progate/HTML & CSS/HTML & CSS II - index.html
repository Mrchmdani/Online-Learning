HTML & CSS II

Advanced HTML/CSS
    In this lesson, we'll be developing a modern web page like the one below.
    Get ready to gain a lot of new knowledge that is essential in web development!
-->
<!--
The Overall Layout
    The web page that we'll be making has the HTML layout shown below.

<header> and <footer>
    Many web pages have headers and footers, so HTML has tags for them.
    Instead of writing <div class="header"> and <div class="footer"> like we did in the previous lesson, we can use the <header> and <footer> tags, which are more commonly used.
-->

<header></header>                               <!-- change from <div class="header"></div> -->
<div class="top-wrapper"></div>
<footer></footer>                               <!--change from <div class="footer"></div> -->

<!-- Example -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Progate</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Write your code here -->
    <header></header>
    <div class="top-wrapper"></div>
    <div class="lesson-wrapper"></div>
    <div class="message-wrapper"></div>
    <footer></footer>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
The Top Layout
    Next we'll be working on the top section.
    Check out the HTML layout in the image below.

background-image
    The top section has an image in the background.
    We can specify this with CSS using the background-image property, like background-image: url(URL);.

background-size
    The image specified with background-image will repeat itself until it fills the whole space.
    If you want to fill it with a single image, you can specify background-size: cover;.

Centering the Elements
   Let's horizontally center the container class.
    We can do this by specifying the left and right margins to auto.
    Note that you must also specify the width when doing so.
    You don't have to understand the meaning of the container class for now, but it will come in handy in the lessons to come. 
-->
<div>
    <h1>LEARN TO CODE</h1>
</div>

<!-- EXAMPLE -->
<div class="top-wrapper">
    <!-- Write your code here -->
    <div class="container">
      <h1>LEARN TO CODE.</h1>
      <h1>LEARN TO BE CREATIVE.</h1>
      <p>Progate is a web service where you can learn programming online.</p>
      <p>We offer you a fully equipped coding environment to get you started.</p>
    </div>

<!--
Opacity and Letter Spacing
    Comparing our web page with the final product, we can see the following differences. In the final product,
    ・The letters are transparent
    ・There is more space between the letters of "LEARN TO CODE."

opacity
    To make an element transparent, you can use the opacity property.
    You can specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0, 0.0 being the most transparent.

letter-spacing
    The letter-spacing property can be used to specify the space between the letters.
-->

<!--
Creating Buttons
    Now let's create some buttons using <a> tags.
    Since the <a> tag is an inline element, we can't specify its size and space.
    Let's find out how to solve this.

Inline-block Elements
    Inline-block elements have the characteristics of both block-level elements and inline elements.
    Like inline elements, they will be aligned horizontally, but you can also specify their size and spacing, like block elements.

display
    <a> tags are inline elements by default, but you can use the display property to change this.
    The display property can have block, inline-block or inline specified.

Specifying Multiple Classes
    If you have several elements that have slightly different CSS, you can extract the common CSS and the individual CSS to different classes, and specify them both.
    You can specify multiple classes by separating them with a space.
-->
<div class="btn blue"></div>
<div class="btn red"></div>

<!--
Adjusting the Layout
    Let's adjust the layout of the top section by focusing on the following:
    ・Changing the button color when the cursor is hovering over it
    ・Making the corners of the buttons rounded
    ・Aligning the text to the center

:hover
    When the cursor is on an element, the element is in the hover state.
    By adding the :hover selector as shown below, we can specify the CSS for when an element is in the hover state.
    Make sure you do not put spaces on either side of the :.

border-radius
    We use the border-radius property to round the corners of elements. The larger the number, the rounder the corners become.

text-align
    The text-align property lets you align inline and inline-block elements.
    Values left, center, or right can be specified.

margin: 0 auto and text-align: center
    We learned that both margin: 0 auto and text-align: center can be used to center elements. 
    Let's look at the differences between the two. We use margin for block-level elements like containers, and text-align for inline and inline-block elements like buttons and text.
-->

<!--
Using Icons
    Let's add icons to our buttons like in the image below.

Font Awesome
    You can easily add icons by using Font Awesome.
    It has a lot of icons that you can use in your web page.
    Check out https://fontawesome.com/ for the list of icons that you can use.

Using Font Awesome
    You can use Font Awesome in the following steps.
    1. Load the Font Awesome CSS inside the <head> tag
    2. Add a <span> tag with the classes fa and fa-icon-name
    (You can find the icon name in the Font Awesome page.)
-->
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">"
</head>
<span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>
<span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>

<!-- EXAMPLE -->

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Progate</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">
    <!-- Load Font Awesome here -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
</head>

<a href="#" class="btn facebook">
    <!-- Add a <span> tag -->
    <span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>
    Sign up with Facebook
</a>
<a href="#" class="btn twitter">
    <!-- Add a <span> tag -->
    <span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>
    Sign up with Twitter
</a>

<!--
The Header Layout
    Let's move on to the header section.
    The HTML layout is shown in the image below.
    Note that the background color of the header is slightly transparent.

opacity and rgba
    We've previously used opacity to make an element transparent.
    But the problem with opacity is that it makes the entire element transparent, including all the child elements.
    If we only want the background color to be transparent, we can use rgba.

rgb
    To learn about rgba, we must first understand the rgb.
    rgb is a way to specify the color with a combination of three values.
    It works just like the hexadecimal format (e.g. #ffffff) that we've learned before.

rgba
    rgba is used when you want to specify the transparency of the color.
    You specify four values for rgba, and the fourth value specifies the transparency from 0.0 to 1.0, 0.0 being the most transparent.
    The example below shows the difference between rgba and opacity.
-->

<!-- EXAMPLE -->

<header>
    <!-- Write your code here -->
    <div class="container">
      <div class="header-left">
        <img class="logo" src="https://prog-8.com/images/html/advanced/main_logo.png">
      </div>
    </div>
  </header>

<!--
Creating a Login Link
    Now we'll work on the login link.
-->

<div class="header-right">
    <a class="login" href="#">Log in</a>
</div>

<!--
Improving the Login Link
    Let's improve the login link by:
    ・Adding some animation to the hover.
    ・Vertically centering the Log in text.

transition
    The transition property can be used to add animations.
    You can specify the target and the duration of the animation.
    The target can be a property, like color, but we often just specify all so it applies to all properties.
    transition is often used with the hover selector.

line-height
    The line-height property can be used to specify the height that the line occupies.

Using line-height to Vertically Center Text
    line-height can also be used to vertically center text.
    Since the text will be placed in the center of the line-height, specifying the same value for the height and the line-height will vertically center the text inside.

Expanding the <a> Tag
    Since the <a> tag is an inline element, it only occupies the space of the text. As a result, we can only click the text area of the button.
    We can fix this by making the <a> tag a block element, which spreads to the size of its parent element.

<!--
The Lesson List Layout
    Let's move on to the lesson list section.
    The HTML layout is shown in the image below.
    We'll also be learning how to change the thickness of the text.

font-weight
    The font-weight property lets you change the thickness of the text.
    You can specify values like normal and bold.
    Since <h1>~<h6> tags have font-weight: bold; specified by default, you can specify font-weight: normal; to change them back to normal.
-->

<div class="lesson-wrapper">
    <!-- Write your code here -->
    <div class="container">
      <div class="heading">
        <h2>Learn Where to Get Started!</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="lessons"></div>
    </div>
</div>

## CHECK CSS code ON HTML & CSS II.css ##

<!-- 
Aligning the Lessons
Now let's work on the lessons section.
Each lesson has a width of 25%.

Specifying the Size With %
By using % instead of px, we can calculate the width based on its parent element's width. The same applies for the height property.

The Layout of the Lesson
The HTML layout of each lesson is shown in the image below.
-->

<div class="lessons">
    <!-- Write your code here -->
    <div class="lesson">
      <div class="lesson-icon">

<!--
Overlapping Elements
    Now let's adjust the layout of each lesson part.
    Normally in HTML, the elements never overlap.
    But you can do this by adding some CSS.
    In this exercise, we'll learn how to place some text on top of an image.

position: absolute;
    You can use position: absolute; to make the elements overlap.
    With position: absolute; you can specify the position relative to the top-left corner of the web page, using the top and left properties.

position: relative;
    You can change the reference point for position: absolute
    by specifying position: relative; to an ancestor element.
    This way, the element with position: absolute specified will be positioned relative to the top-left corner of the ancestor element.

Creating a 3D Button
    Let's learn how to make the button look 3D by adding shadows to it.
    We'll also be learning how to change the mouse pointer type.

box-shadow
    The box-shadow property is used to add shadows to elements.
    We can use it by specifying its horizontal length, vertical length, and the color.

cursor
    The cursor property can be used to change the type of the mouse pointer, like in the image below.
    Some HTML tags like the <a> tag have the cursor property set to pointer by default. 
-->

<!--
Pressing a Button
    Let's add some more CSS to the button to make it look like it's been pressed when you click on it.
    We can do this by doing the following things when the button is clicked.
    ・Remove the shadow
    ・Lowering the button by the length of the shadow

:active
    The :active selector can be used to add CSS for when an element is being clicked, like in the example below.

Canceling CSS
    You can remove the shadow by specifying box-shadow: none;.
    Many CSS properties can be canceled by specifying none.

Usage of position: relative;
    We previously learned how to use position: relative; with position: absolute;, but its actual role is to position the element relative to its normal position.
    Like position: absolute;, you use the top and left properties.

Pressing a Button
    We'll add the following CSS to make the button look like it's been pressed.
    ・Set box-shadow to none
    ・Use position: relative; with top to lower the element by the length of the shadow

<!--
Fixing the Header
    To finish off, let's learn how to fix an element to a certain position, so that we can keep the header at the top even when you scroll down.

Fixing the Position of an Element
    We can use position: fixed; to fix an element to a certain position of the screen. We can specify it by combining it with the top and left properties.

The Stack Order of Elements
    We learned that we use the position property to make the elements overlap, but sometimes they won't be stacked in the desired order.
    In the image below, the icon images are stacked on top of the header.
    Let's learn how to fix this.

z-index
    The z-index property lets you change the stack order of the elements.
    The element with the greater z-index will be displayed on top.
    Keep in mind that the z-index property will only take effect when combined with the position property.
