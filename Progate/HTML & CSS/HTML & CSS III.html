Media Queries
    From here on, we'll be learning about media queries.
    They allow you to specify different CSS depending on the size of the device.

Using Media Queries
    Let's learn how to write media queries.
    The syntax is as follows: @media (condition) { .... }.
    The CSS inside { } will be applied only when the condition is met.3

max-width and min-width
    We can specify the max-width or the min-width as a condition.
    When max-width: 1000px is specified, the CSS will be applied only when the width of the screen is 1000px or less.
    On the other hand, with min-width the CSS will be applied when the width of the screen is the specified size or more.

Breakpoints
    The value you specify for the max-width or the min-width is called a breakpoint.
    We'll be using 670px as the breakpoint for smartphones, and 1000px for tablets.
