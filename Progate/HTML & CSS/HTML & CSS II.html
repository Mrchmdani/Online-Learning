HTML & CSS II

Advanced HTML/CSS
    In this lesson, we'll be developing a modern web page like the one below.
    Get ready to gain a lot of new knowledge that is essential in web development!
-->
<!--
The Overall Layout
    The web page that we'll be making has the HTML layout shown below.

<header> and <footer>
    Many web pages have headers and footers, so HTML has tags for them.
    Instead of writing <div class="header"> and <div class="footer"> like we did in the previous lesson, we can use the <header> and <footer> tags, which are more commonly used.
-->

<header></header>                               <!-- change from <div class="header"></div> -->
<div class="top-wrapper"></div>
<footer></footer>                               <!--change from <div class="footer"></div> -->

<!-- Example -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Progate</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Write your code here -->
    <header></header>
    <div class="top-wrapper"></div>
    <div class="lesson-wrapper"></div>
    <div class="message-wrapper"></div>
    <footer></footer>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
The Top Layout
    Next we'll be working on the top section.
    Check out the HTML layout in the image below.

background-image
    The top section has an image in the background.
    We can specify this with CSS using the background-image property, like background-image: url(URL);.

background-size
    The image specified with background-image will repeat itself until it fills the whole space.
    If you want to fill it with a single image, you can specify background-size: cover;.

Centering the Elements
   Let's horizontally center the container class.
    We can do this by specifying the left and right margins to auto.
    Note that you must also specify the width when doing so.
    You don't have to understand the meaning of the container class for now, but it will come in handy in the lessons to come. 
-->
<div>
    <h1>LEARN TO CODE</h1>
</div>

<!-- EXAMPLE -->
<div class="top-wrapper">
    <!-- Write your code here -->
    <div class="container">
      <h1>LEARN TO CODE.</h1>
      <h1>LEARN TO BE CREATIVE.</h1>
      <p>Progate is a web service where you can learn programming online.</p>
      <p>We offer you a fully equipped coding environment to get you started.</p>
    </div>

Opacity and Letter Spacing
    Comparing our web page with the final product, we can see the following differences. In the final product,
    ・The letters are transparent
    ・There is more space between the letters of "LEARN TO CODE."

opacity
    To make an element transparent, you can use the opacity property.
    You can specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0, 0.0 being the most transparent.

letter-spacing
    The letter-spacing property can be used to specify the space between the letters.

Creating Buttons
    Now let's create some buttons using <a> tags.
    Since the <a> tag is an inline element, we can't specify its size and space.
    Let's find out how to solve this.

Inline-block Elements
    Inline-block elements have the characteristics of both block-level elements and inline elements.
    Like inline elements, they will be aligned horizontally, but you can also specify their size and spacing, like block elements.

display
    <a> tags are inline elements by default, but you can use the display property to change this.
    The display property can have block, inline-block or inline specified.

Specifying Multiple Classes
    If you have several elements that have slightly different CSS, you can extract the common CSS and the individual CSS to different classes, and specify them both.
    You can specify multiple classes by separating them with a space.
-->
<div class="btn blue"></div>
<div class="btn red"></div>

<!--
Adjusting the Layout
    Let's adjust the layout of the top section by focusing on the following:
    ・Changing the button color when the cursor is hovering over it
    ・Making the corners of the buttons rounded
    ・Aligning the text to the center

:hover
    When the cursor is on an element, the element is in the hover state.
    By adding the :hover selector as shown below, we can specify the CSS for when an element is in the hover state.
    Make sure you do not put spaces on either side of the :.

border-radius
    We use the border-radius property to round the corners of elements. The larger the number, the rounder the corners become.

text-align
    The text-align property lets you align inline and inline-block elements.
    Values left, center, or right can be specified.

margin: 0 auto and text-align: center
    We learned that both margin: 0 auto and text-align: center can be used to center elements. 
    Let's look at the differences between the two. We use margin for block-level elements like containers, and text-align for inline and inline-block elements like buttons and text.

Using Icons
    Let's add icons to our buttons like in the image below.

Font Awesome
    You can easily add icons by using Font Awesome.
    It has a lot of icons that you can use in your web page.
    Check out https://fontawesome.com/ for the list of icons that you can use.

Using Font Awesome
    You can use Font Awesome in the following steps.
    1. Load the Font Awesome CSS inside the <head> tag
    2. Add a <span> tag with the classes fa and fa-icon-name
    (You can find the icon name in the Font Awesome page.)
-->
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">"
</head>
<span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>
<span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>

<!-- EXAMPLE -->

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Progate</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">
    <!-- Load Font Awesome here -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
</head>

<a href="#" class="btn facebook">
    <!-- Add a <span> tag -->
    <span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>
    Sign up with Facebook
</a>
<a href="#" class="btn twitter">
    <!-- Add a <span> tag -->
    <span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>
    Sign up with Twitter
</a>

The Header Layout
    Let's move on to the header section.
    The HTML layout is shown in the image below.
    Note that the background color of the header is slightly transparent.

opacity and rgba
    We've previously used opacity to make an element transparent.
    But the problem with opacity is that it makes the entire element transparent, including all the child elements.
    If we only want the background color to be transparent, we can use rgba.

rgb
    To learn about rgba, we must first understand the rgb.
    rgb is a way to specify the color with a combination of three values.
    It works just like the hexadecimal format (e.g. #ffffff) that we've learned before.

rgba
    rgba is used when you want to specify the transparency of the color.
    You specify four values for rgba, and the fourth value specifies the transparency from 0.0 to 1.0, 0.0 being the most transparent.
    The example below shows the difference between rgba and opacity.
-->

<!-- EXAMPLE -->

<header>
    <!-- Write your code here -->
    <div class="container">
      <div class="header-left">
        <img class="logo" src="https://prog-8.com/images/html/advanced/main_logo.png">
      </div>
    </div>
  </header>

<!--
Creating a Login Link
    Now we'll work on the login link.
-->

<div class="header-right">
    <a class="login" href="#">Log in</a>
</div>
