Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 3 column and 10000 total rows
ii. Business table = 12 column and 10000 total rows
iii. Category table = 2 column and 10000 total rows
iv. Checkin table = 3 column and 10000 total rows
v. elite_years table = 2 column and 10000 total rows
vi. friend table = 2 column and 10000 total rows
vii. hours table = 2 column and 10000 total rows
viii. photo table = 4 column and 10000 total rows
ix. review table = 9 column and 10000 total rows
x. tip table = 5 column and 10000 total rows
xi. user table = 20 column and 10000 total rows
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 distinct id (primary key)
ii. Hours = 1562 distinct business_id (foreign key)
iii. Category = 2643 distinct business_id (foreign key)
iv. Attribute = 1115 distinct business_id (foreign key)
v. Review = 10000 distinct id (primary key), 8090 distinct business_id (foreign key), 9581 distinct user_id (foreign key)
vi. Checkin = 493 distinct business_id (foreign key)
vii. Photo = 10000 distinct id (primary key), 6493 distinct business_id (foreign key)
viii. Tip = 537 distinct user_id (foreign key), 3979 distinct business_id (foreign key)
ix. User = 10000 distinct id (primary key)
x. Friend = 11 distinct user_id (foreign key)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 distinct user_id (foreign key)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: 	SELECT COUNT(*)

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours? yes


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews? yes
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

I think location plays an important role for the type of business category. Based on the table, Restaurant that have 2-3 stars mostly open in downtown area where people go there for work and not for recreation.
So the restaurant not focused with flavour because people will go there to eat and then back to work. It is different with 4-5 star where you can enjoy the taste of food and many of this place have big park on it.
Well, this in only my conclusion based on the table because i don't live in the Toronto and only see the place from the google maps.

+------------------+------------------------+---------+-----------------------+-------------+-------+--------------+----------------------+
| name             | neighborhood           | city    | address               | category    | stars | review_count | hours                |
+------------------+------------------------+---------+-----------------------+-------------+-------+--------------+----------------------+
| 99 Cent Sushi    | Downtown Core          | Toronto | 389 Church Street     | Restaurants |   2.0 |            5 | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |
| Big Smoke Burger | Downtown Core          | Toronto | 260 Yonge Street      | Restaurants |   3.0 |           47 | Saturday|10:30-21:00 |
| Pizzaiolo        | Entertainment District | Toronto | 270 Adelaide Street W | Restaurants |   3.0 |           34 | Saturday|10:00-4:00  |
| Edulis           | Niagara                | Toronto | 169 Niagara Street    | Restaurants |   4.0 |           89 | Saturday|18:00-23:00 |
| Cabin Fever      | High Park              | Toronto | 1669 Bloor Street W   | Restaurants |   4.5 |           26 | Saturday|16:00-2:00  |
| Sushi Osaka      | Etobicoke              | Toronto | 5084 Dundas Street W  | Restaurants |   4.5 |            8 | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |
+------------------+------------------------+---------+-----------------------+-------------+-------+--------------+----------------------+

SQL code used for analysis:	SELECT name, neighborhood, city, address, category, stars, review_count, hours
				FROM business b
				INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
				INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
				WHERE city = 'Toronto' AND category = 'Restaurants'
				GROUP BY name
				ORDER BY stars

		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
+--------------------+------------+------------+---------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+---------+
| COUNT(DISTINCT id) | MAX(stars) | MIN(stars) |    AVG(stars) | MAX(review_count) | MIN(review_count) | AVG(review_count) | is_open |
+--------------------+------------+------------+---------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+---------+
|               1520 |        5.0 |        1.0 | 3.52039473684 |               700 |                 3 |     23.1980263158 |       0 |
|               8480 |        5.0 |        1.0 | 3.67900943396 |              3873 |                 3 |     31.7570754717 |       1 |
+--------------------+------------+------------+---------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+---------+

i. Difference 1: review_count
         The business that still open have more review count than that are close as you can see from tabel above.
         
ii. Difference 2: stars
         The business that still open have more average stars than that are close as you can see from tabel above.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis: 	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id), MAX(stars), MIN(stars), AVG(stars), MAX(review_count), MIN(review_count), AVG(review_count), is_open
				FROM business a
				GROUP BY is_open

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, 
predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. 
Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	
	I want to know the most or favorite category business in every city that still open
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
	
	The data that i need for the analysis is business tabel and category tabel. After that i join two tabel together and sort/filter them based on category, because i want to know the most business in every city based on category.
	The reason i chose this analysis is so people can see the most favorite business that still open on each city.
